- Be concise with docstrings. 
- Only add docstrings when the information provided is not implicitly clear from the parameter / function names or types.
- Functions that are not used outside a given class i.e. functions that are considered "private" should have names prefixed with "_"..
- Use type hints for all parameters and return values.
- Class members that are internal to the class should be prefixed with "_".
- Do not include type hints in docstrings.
- Don't try to "strip()" strings arbitrarily unless requested or clearly required for the task.
- Use dedent to format multi-line string literals and correctly handle preceding whitespace while still maintaining readability.
- Prefer not using recursion when possible.

Follow the following guidelines when adding a new "Command" implementation - 
- Check the "command.py" file to understand how the Command interface is structured.
- Register the new Command with the Shell class.
- When executed a command is structured as follows. Make sure to follow it when adding examples.

```
▶command_name v1 -f v2 --foo v3｜Do something■
✅File updated successfully■

▶command_name v1 -f v2 --foo v3｜Erroneous data■
❌Error■
```

Specifically note the following for the command itself - 
- The command starts with "▶"
- "▶" is followed by the command name
- The command name is followed by a space
- The command name is followed by the parameters
- The command data is separated by a pipe (|) from the command name and parameters. The command data is optional.

Note the following for the command result - 
- The command result starts with "✅" if the command was executed successfully
- The command result starts with "❌" if the command was executed with an error
- When adding examples make sure to include a description of what kind of changes it makes. If modifying external state, then include details about the initial state and the final state after running the command.
- Make sure to add a "manual" with detailed instructions on the command parameters and examples.

When writing tests - 
- DO NOT mock anything unless otherwise requested. 

If you need to kill a process - 
- Use "ps aux | grep <process_name>" to find the process ID of the process you want to debug or interact with. 
- Use "kill -9 <process_id>" to kill the process.

When determining code to remove - 
- Make use of the knowledge that "internal" functions, parameters and classes are prefixed with "_". If they are not used elsewhere in the code base then they can be safely removed.
