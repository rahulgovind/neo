# ARCHITECTURE.md Update Summary

## Changes Made

1. **File Search Commands**
   - Updated descriptions of file_text_search and file_path_search commands
   - Added details about parameters and search capabilities
   - Clarified the workspace-aware nature of these commands

2. **Wait Command**
   - Added documentation for the `wait` command
   - Described its use of the Clock abstraction
   - Explained its utility for testing and rate-limiting

3. **Clock Utility**
   - Enhanced the description of the Clock interface
   - Added detailed documentation for both implementations (RealTimeClock and FakeClock)
   - Explained testing features like `advance()` and `await_sleeps()`

4. **Message Structure**
   - Added a new section describing the message structure
   - Documented the ContentBlock hierarchy and its implementations
   - Explained how messages support multiple content types

5. **Additional Components**
   - Fixed numeration errors in the Additional Components section
   - Ensured correct sequential numbering

6. **Future Considerations**
   - Added more potential improvements based on code exploration
   - Included suggestions for enhanced file diffing, time utilities, etc.

## Remaining Improvements

1. **Component Diagram**
   - The current component diagram could be updated to include the Message Structure as a separate entity
   - Better visualize the relationship between Shell, Commands, and Agent components

2. **Shell Component**
   - Add a dedicated section for the Shell component which manages command execution
   - Explain how it validates and processes command calls

3. **Commands Refactoring**
   - There's evidence of command naming inconsistency (neofind vs file_path_search)
   - Document the transition or standardize the naming in the architecture document

4. **Prompt Management**
   - Document how system prompts are managed and customized
   - Explain the role of agent/prompts/neo.txt and agent/prompts/checkpoint.md

5. **Session Structure**
   - More detailed information about the structure and lifecycle of sessions
   - Explain the relationship between Session, Agent, and AgentState

The updated ARCHITECTURE.md now provides a more comprehensive and accurate view of the codebase, especially regarding utilities, commands, and message structures. These components are crucial for understanding how Neo handles conversations and executes commands.
