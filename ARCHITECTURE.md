# Neo Architecture

This document provides an overview of Neo's architecture, design decisions, and implementation details to help developers understand and extend the codebase.

## System Overview

Neo is a CLI application that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide an interactive assistant, with optional file operations capabilities. It provides a versatile chat interface where users can:

1. Have general conversations and ask questions
2. Get information, explanations, and creative assistance
3. Work with files in an optional workspace directory
4. Receive code assistance and apply changes when needed

The application uses the OpenAI API format for LLM interactions, which allows it to work with both OpenAI models and compatible alternatives.

## Component Architecture

Neo follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Quality Assurance and Linting

Neo integrates code quality checks directly into file operations:

- **Linting Framework**: A modular, extensible linting system checks code quality during write operations
  - Implemented using a registry pattern to support multiple file types
  - Initially supports Python files with pylint, easily extendable to other languages
  - Files are written even when lint fails, but users receive detailed error reports

- **Design Principles**:
  - Separation of concerns: Linting logic is isolated from file operations
  - Extensibility: Adding support for new file types requires minimal code changes
  - Non-blocking: Linting issues warn users but don't prevent writing files

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements

1. **Web Interface**: Add a web-based UI as an alternative to the terminal interface
2. **Project Templates**: Support for project-specific templates and configurations
3. **IDE Integration**: Extensions for popular IDEs like VSCode or JetBrains
4. **Collaborative Mode**: Support for multiple users working with the same assistant
5. **Version Control Integration**: Direct integration with Git for tracking changes

**Database** (`src/neo/service/database/`):

- Implements repository pattern for session persistence
- Uses SQLite for efficient local data storage
- Provides data models for session state
- Manages connection pooling and database operations
- Enables scalable, persistent session tracking

The Service Layer is designed to support both CLI and potential web/API interfaces, providing a consistent programming model regardless of the interface being used.

**Testing the Service Layer**:

Testing the Service layer requires special considerations due to:
- Global state in the NEO_HOME variable defined at import time
- Database connections established when modules are imported
- Session IDs based on timestamps with potential for conflicts in test suites

We've implemented two testing strategies:
- Traditional unit tests with setUp/tearDown for normal isolation
- A standalone isolated script that guarantees complete isolation by setting environment variables before any imports

Key insights for testing this layer:
- NEO_HOME must be set before importing any Neo-related modules for true isolation
- Each test should use a unique database file to avoid conflicts
- The Service.list_sessions() method returns List[SessionInfo], which has been fixed to match its implementation 
- Comprehensive test coverage uses real (non-mocked) objects for higher fidelity




The Service layer provides a higher-level API for session management and persistent storage:

- **Service** (src/neo/service/service.py): Provides core service functionalities for session management and messaging
  - Creates and manages sessions with persistent state
  - Processes messages through the appropriate agent
  - Supports temporary and named sessions
  - Provides session listing and retrieval capabilities

- **SessionManager** (src/neo/service/session_manager.py): Manages session state persistence
