# Neo Architecture

This document provides an overview of Neo's architecture, design decisions, and implementation details to help developers understand and extend the codebase.

## System Overview

Neo is a CLI application that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide an interactive assistant, with optional file operations capabilities. It provides a versatile chat interface where users can:

1. Have general conversations and ask questions
2. Get information, explanations, and creative assistance
3. Work with files in an optional workspace directory
4. Receive code assistance and apply changes when needed

The application uses the OpenAI API format for LLM interactions, which allows it to work with both OpenAI models and compatible alternatives.

## Component Architecture

Neo follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Key Components

#### Model (src/core/model.py)

The Model component provides an abstraction over the LLM client API:

- Manages communication with the LLM using the OpenAI API format
- Handles message preprocessing and response postprocessing
- Processes commands and their results through the LLM
- Supports auto-execution of multiple commands in sequence
- Extracts command calls from LLM responses

#### Commands (src/core/commands/)

Neo implements a consistent command framework for interacting with the file system and other resources:

- Base `Command` class (src/core/command.py) provides a unified interface for all commands
- Commands use a consistent CLI-like syntax for parameter handling
- Each command includes rich documentation and usage examples
- Commands provide structured error handling for reliable execution

Available commands include:
- `read_file`: Read and display file contents with flexible line number options
- `write_file`: Create or overwrite files with provided content
- `update_file`: Apply changes to files using a diff-like syntax
- `grep`: Search for patterns in files with filtering options
- `find`: Locate files and directories based on name patterns
- `bash`: Execute arbitrary shell commands (used as a fallback)

Each command follows the Command Pattern, implementing:
- A template() method that defines parameters and documentation
- A process() method that implements the command's functionality

#### Agent (src/agent/agent.py)

The Agent component orchestrates the interaction between the user, Model, and Functions:

#### Chat (src/apps/chat.py)

The Chat component provides the user interface:

- Manages the interactive terminal session
- Processes user inputs and special commands
- Displays formatted responses
- Handles history and session management

#### CLI (src/apps/cli.py)

The CLI component ties everything together:

- Parses command-line arguments
- Sets up the application environment
- Initializes all components with appropriate configurations
- Provides the main entry point for the application

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements

1. **Web Interface**: Add a web-based UI as an alternative to the terminal interface
2. **Project Templates**: Support for project-specific templates and configurations
3. **IDE Integration**: Extensions for popular IDEs like VSCode or JetBrains
4. **Collaborative Mode**: Support for multiple users working with the same assistant
5. **Version Control Integration**: Direct integration with Git for tracking changes

### Additional Components

The project includes several components not detailed above:

#### 1. Web Application (src/apps/web/)

Neo includes a web-based interface as an alternative to the terminal:
- `app.py`: Implements the web server and routes
- `launcher.py`: Provides entry points for starting the web application

#### 2. Database (src/database/)

A database component for persistent storage:
- Supports storing conversation history and context between sessions
- Provides data access abstractions for the rest of the application

#### 3. Structured Logging (src/logging/)

A dedicated logging infrastructure:
- Implements structured logging for better analysis
- Provides consistent log formatting across the application
